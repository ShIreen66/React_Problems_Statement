# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose
To develop a React-based meal planner that allows users to manage their daily food intake  
by adding, viewing, and removing food items under different meal categories: *Breakfast*,  
*Lunch, and **Dinner*.

## 1.2 Scope
The application focuses on frontend-only development using React. It provides users with an  
interactive and intuitive UI to plan meals and persist them locally for a single day.

# 2. Functional Requirements

- *FR1*: Users can add a food item under a selected meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner).
- *FR2*: The system must display lists of food items under each meal category.
- *FR3*: Users can delete any item from the meal list.
- *FR4*: Users can view the current date on the UI.
- *FR5*: The system must persist meal data in localStorage so it remains after page reload.
- *FR6: Users can clear all meals at once using a **Clear All* button.
- *FR7*: System must validate input (e.g., no empty entries).

# 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- *NFR1*: The system should be built using functional components with React Hooks.
- *NFR2*: The UI should be responsive and clean.
- *NFR3*: Feedback such as success messages (e.g., using react-toastify) should be displayed on actions.
- *NFR4*: App state should reflect real-time changes without requiring a page reload.
